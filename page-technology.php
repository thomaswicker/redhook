				        <p>Some industry estimates suggest that the software project failure rate exceeds 70%. This appalling statistic is perhaps not so surprising when you consider the complexity of a large scale software project and the challenges of clear communications and expectation settings between the development team and the business sponsors.</p>

						<p>Redhook e-Tech Consulting is skilled at getting to the heart of the issues related to a stalled or failing project. Our engagements execute via time proven best practices with cross disciplined perspectives.</p>

						<p>A frequent cause of software projects failure is a break down in the communications and expectations between the development team and the business sponsors. Redhook e-Tech Consulting is highly effective at bridging this communication gap. Our team understands technology and development team dynamics, so we can rapidly assess the issues faced by the team.</p>

						<p>Our engagements are driven by the following steps:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Understand the strategy, business drivers, and business constraints.</li>

							<li>Perform a situational analysis of the software, team’s skills, organizational effectiveness, and communication mechanisms.</li>

							<li>Clearly communicate options to the executive decision makers to move forward.</li>

							<li>Recommend the best option and define next steps.</li>

						</ul>

						<p>Frequently we are engaged by our clients for a leadership role in bringing about these changes and delivering this product into production.</p>

				        <p>Security can take many forms and therefore be compromised in a number of different ways. Data encryption, data retention, Off-site backups, User and Group Role Definitions, Physical Plant Security, 3rd Parties (Vendors, Credit Card Processors, …) all present unique challenges to protect.</p>

						<p>In its simplest form, security comes down to defining the answers to a few simple questions:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Who is authorized for the asset?</li>

							<li>Who has access to the asset? And what permissions do they have to interact with the asset?</li>

							<li>Is there a timeliness to the security around the asset?</li>

						</ul>

						<p>Redhook e-Tech utilizes many time-proven templates to audit your organization in a detailed and deliberate fashion. The result is a very detailed and fully encompassing security audit of your companies hard and soft assets. Frequently our clients will engage us to develop solutions that will prevent any security threats that have been documented in our reports.</p>

				        <p>This service is offered to the small business market (less than $50M revenue) that may not have the ongoing requirements or resources that would dictate a full-time person filling this role.

							<li>Identify technology trends and evolving social behavior that may support or impede the success of the business.</li>
							<li>Establish a governance process that meets government, partner, and company expectations for customer information privacy.</li>
							<li>Strategic Technology Advising and Road-maps</li>
							<li>Technology Selection Analysis and Recommendations</li>
							<li>Build vs. Buy Decisions</li>
